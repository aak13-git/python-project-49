My Mind Games project contains 5 mini-games, in order to win which you need to give the correct answer 3 times in a row, in case of an incorrect answer the game will end. Before launching the games, install the uv package manager, the installation instructions are located at the link: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/
List of mini-games:
1. "Parity check". The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd. You can start the games by entering the command in the terminal: brain-even;
2. "Calculator". The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example, 35 + 16, which needs to be calculated and the correct answer written down. You can start the game by entering the command in the terminal: brain-calc;
3. "Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)". The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25-50. The user must calculate and enter the largest common divisor of these numbers. You can start the game by entering the command in the terminal: brain-gcd;
4. "Arithmetic progression".  We show the player a series of numbers that forms an arithmetic progression by replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number. You can start the game by entering the command in the terminal: brain-progression;
5. "Is it a prime number?". We show the player a number and he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it is odd. You can start the game by entering the command: brain-prime in the terminal.
